# My advent of code

My solutions to the Advent of Code of 2023 and 2024.

Some of the days have only the solutions of part 2, as I wrote it over the part 1 solutions.

When a day day has two solutions is because the part 1 and part 2 solutions are very different.
Some days were solved by hand with helper programs, so the program does not give the solution to the problem.

I haven't uploaded the inputs as mentioned in the [AoC web](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about)
